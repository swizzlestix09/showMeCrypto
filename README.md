## About:
An application designed to show you a list of USD Cryptocurrencies, which upon selection will render a 5-day price chart. Hovering over the chart line will show you the price at that time. Upon load, this application will capture your IP address to create a record in which we can save your email if you would like to be notified of future features. If you don’t want your email stored, we can remove it upon request.



## Features:


- _Simplistic Design_: This page was designed utilizing Material UI to keep it simple yet styled.

- _List_: The user mainly interacts with a timer- that is the first focal point of the page. There is a slider that allows you to set up to 10 minutes on the timer for your meditative needs.

- _Chart_: Pesky Kids? Doorbell ringing? Unexpected Zoom meeting? No worries; we anticipated you would be a busy boss. We've implemented a start/pause button using setInterval & clear interval, as well as a reset button in case you got so distracted you forgot about us (it's okay - we don't take it personally)

- _Email Storage / Deletion of Record_: Utilizing PostgreSQL, we have a bank of affirmations that you can change randomly by clicking the change affirmation button. You deserve to be the pilot of your meditative journey.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
